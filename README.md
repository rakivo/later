## The [later](https://github.com/rakivo/later) is lightweight, convenient and self-hosted tool that allows you to keep all the videos you wanna watch soon without the need to open a lot of unnecessary tabs in your browser.

### To run:
```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rakivo/later && cd later
go run main
```

### Usage:
> Simply paste your link into the input field and watch it appear on the right side, with a single click on thumbnail you can that video in the other window

### Future Plans:
> I plan to expand support beyond just [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos to include other platforms and content types.
